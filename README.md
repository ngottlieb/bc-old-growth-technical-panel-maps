# Fall 2021 BC Old Growth Technical Advisory Panel Mapping

On November 2nd, the BC government [announced it's intent](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2021FLNRO0068-002088) to pursue "priority deferral" of 2.6 million hectares of old growth forest. This announcement was coupled with the release of the Old Growth Technical Advisory Panel's [report on priority deferrals](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/forestry/stewardship/old-growth-forests/summary_for_g2g_package.pdf) and [associated maps](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/old-growth-forests/old-growth-maps), including the latest inventory data for old and rare ecosystems in BC.

The release included map images that are not high enough resolution to use at any sort of meaningful scale. It also included geospatial data; those data were used to make these maps. The text describing each map is from the government's "[Brief Overview of Spatial Data.](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/ftp/HTS/external/!publish/OldGrowthStrategicReview/Recommendation6/TechnicalAdvisoryPanel/Spatial_Data/Brief%20Description%20Old%20Growth%20Technical%20Advisory%20Panel%20Maps%20and%20Spatial%20Data.Maps1-8.Nov02.pdf)"
